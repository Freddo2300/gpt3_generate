in order to make the API function, you will need to create a python file 'constants.py' in which the variable 'OPENAI_API_KEY' should go.

## Git basics
use git bash or powershell to run git commands. In order to clone project into local repository, run 'git clone https://github.com/Freddo2300/gpt3_generate.git".

Next you will want to run 'git branch -M main' to create your main branch

Once the project is cloned, these are the most common git commands:
- git pull 				: pulls all changes from remote to local repository
- git add <file1><file2>...<filenth>	: add locally changed files for staging
- git rm --cached <file1>...<filenth>	: remove file from remote, but not from local
- git branch <branch-name>		: creates a new branch
- git checkout <branch-name>		: switches to another branch
- git commit -m "<message>"		: commit added files to be pushed to remote
- git push -u origin main		: pushes local changes to remote github repo
